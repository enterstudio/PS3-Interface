This application is part of a joint effort between Tymm Twillman, Steven Swarztrauber and John Schimmel.

Processing PS3 Interface is the software side of a single switch accessible PS3 controller. If a person can control their computer mouse, via a regular mouse, trackball or head mouse they can have the option to play a PS3. Using an PIC Bitwhacker as the PS3 Controller interface it connects to an Arduino that relays the message back to Processing.

This Processing app requires you to install the ProXML library from http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/proxml/ .



I will update this README with more information soon

The actual interface to the PS3 is through a USB Pic Bitwhacker, an amazing device from Brian Schmalz, http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW/. We ordered ours premade from Sparkfun, http://www.sparkfun.com/products/762

We use the arduino to communicate from the PC to the Pic bitwhcker. The bitwhacker sends the appropriate ps3 commands to the game console.

The Bitwhacker site on an Arduino shield and the connections are as followed...

Arduino pin     Pic bitwhacker pin
10  -------->   2
11  -------->   0
13  -------->   1
Grnd    ---->   Grnd


1) Load the .pde sketch code onto the arduino
2) Load the .hex file onto the pic bitwhacker with the windows hex loader. 
    (The hex code was developed by Tymm Twillman and emulates a ps3 controller.)
3) Wire up to an arduino to the pic bitwhacker
4) Plug Bitwhacker usb into ps3
4) Plug Arduino into computer
5) Turn on Processing PS3 sketch and select correct serial port from bottom button bar on the app.
6) try to control ps3 up/down arrows for test
7) enjoy!
